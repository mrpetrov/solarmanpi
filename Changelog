1.7
Don't bother turning the solar pump on for now - it is absent anyway.
New config mode introduced:
mode=3
forces only furnace pump ON.
Changed temp diff requirements: solar comes on if at least 8 degrees C hotter,
was 5 C; furnace now needs 5 C more than boiler, was 3 C. And all boiler
comparisons now use the hotter sensor, which sadly is placed too low, but for
now will have to do.
So, currently the system practically controls boiler valve opening and logs
the temps.

ReadSensors() now makes corrections upon too wild data of max 2 C. It also
is a lot more informative for the corrections in the log file.
Changed the diff required between furnace temp and boiler to 1.5 C to use as
a heat source.
Critical temps changes: max boiler t=70, max furnace t=77, max solar temp=88

Fixed some typos. Added _Prev vars for temperature sensor readings and the
controls[] array. The controls[] array also got a new ctrlstatecycles[5]
array which will count the 10 second cycles spent in the last state; zeroed
upon change of state. Added sensible init values to said arrays.
Tweaked ReadSensors() to log a warning when it hits trouble, and to
deal nicely with too wild changes to sensor data, i.e. it now makes
changes no bigger than 3 degrees C, and logs when it corrects data. It only
takes raw data in upon startup - there is a var just_started to allow this.
Changed the format of the data in solar_data.csv - now its easier to read,
and it also contains the used HeatingMode/IdleMode.
Critical temps changes: max boiler t=77, max solar temp=90

Don't bother turning the solar pump on for now - it is absent anyway.
New config mode introduced:
mode=3
forces only furnace pump ON.
Changed temp diff requirements: solar comes on if at least 8 degrees C hotter,
was 5 C; furnace now needs 5 C more than boiler, was 3 C. And all boiler
comparisons now use the hotter sensor, which sadly is placed too low, but for
now will have to do.
So, currently the system practically controls boiler valve opening and logs
the temps.
